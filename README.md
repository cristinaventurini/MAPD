Final projects for the course of *Management and Analysis of Physics Dataset (Mod. A and B)* by professors Gianmaria Collazuol, Andreas Peters and Jacopo Pazzini, first year master course in Physics of Data, Padua.


Both for the MOD A and the MOD B part there were final projects to wrap up the course.<br>

For MOD A, together with my group, we implemented and simulated a FIR Filter using VHDL.  <br>

For MOD B, there were two final projects, always carried out in groups: <br>

- The first one consisted in some exercises concerning redundancy, basic criptography, object storage technology, REST APIs and Block Chain Technology. <br>
- The second was a project in which we worked with data coming from CMS with the goal of setting an upper limit to the branching fraction of FCNC (flavour changing neutral currents) decay of 𝑡𝑡 → 𝐻𝑞 + 𝑊𝑏 → 𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑝𝑡𝑜𝑛, using distributed computing.
